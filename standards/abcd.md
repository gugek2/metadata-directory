description: |
  The Access to Biological Collections Data (ABCD) Schema is an evolving
  comprehensive standard for the access to and exchange of data about specimens
  and observations (a.k.a. primary biodiversity data). The ABCD Schema attempts
  to be comprehensive and highly structured, supporting data from a wide
  variety of databases. It is compatible with several existing data
  standards. Parallel structures exist so that either (or both) atomised data
  and free-text can be accommodated.
